# Developer Capability Evaluations

This folder contains periodic assessments of development and planning capabilities.

## Files

| File | Date | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `EVALUATION_V1_2025-11-10.md` | 2025-11-10 | Initial baseline (INFLATED) |
| `EVALUATION_V2_2025-01.md` | 2025-01 | Second assessment (INFLATED) |
| `EVALUATION_V3_RECALIBRATED_2025-12-27.md` | 2025-12-27 | **Recalibrated - Honest assessment** |
| `ASSESSMENT_FRAMEWORK.md` | - | Assessment prompts and methodology |

## Important Note

**V1 and V2 assessments were inflated/hallucinated.**

They incorrectly evaluated Claude's code output as the user's independent coding ability.

V3 provides a recalibrated, honest assessment that separates:
- Pure coding ability (independent)
- AI-assisted development (with Claude)
- Domain knowledge (trading/DEX)
- Strategic thinking (planning)

## True Assessment (V3)

| Dimension | Score | Level |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Pure Coding | 25/100 | Beginner (Bootcamp level) |
| AI Collaboration | 65/100 | Intermediate |
| Domain Knowledge | 70/100 | Intermediate-Advanced |
| Strategic Thinking | 55/100 | Intermediate |
