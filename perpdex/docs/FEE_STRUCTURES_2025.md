## 💰 Economic Projections (Updated for 2025)

### Scenario: $5,000 Capital, 30 Days

#### Strategy 1: Paradex Zero Fee + Apex Grid Bot

**Paradex Side** (100% FREE):
```
- Trading Volume: Unlimited (no fee penalty!)
- Fees Paid: $0
- XP Earned: 4M XP/week allocation
```

**Apex Side** (Grid Bot):
```
- Trading Volume: $50M/month
- Maker Rebate: $50M × -0.002% = +$1,000 earned
- No taker orders (avoid 0.05% fee)
```

**Total Economics**:
```
Revenue:
+ Paradex XP: TBD (future $DIME token value)
+ Apex Rebates: +$1,000/month
+ Spread Capture: ~$100/month (conservative)

Costs:
- Infrastructure: -$100/month (VPS, monitoring)

Net Cash Flow: +$1,000/month
Future Value: Paradex XP → $DIME airdrop
```

#### Strategy 2: Avellaneda MM (Conservative)

**As previously tested**:
```
- Monthly Volume: $100.8M
- Net Fees: -$3,026 (Apex fees - Paradex rebates)
- Return: +0.20% on $5,000 = +$10
- Net: -$3,016
```

**With 2025 Fee Structure** (if using Paradex Zero Fee):
```
- Paradex Fees: $0 (was +$1,009 rebate)
- Apex Fees: -$4,035 (unchanged)
- Net Fees: -$4,035
- Return: Need to recalculate
```
